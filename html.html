			<em>What Is HTML?</em>
		</h1>
		</div>
		<p class ="pg">
			HTML is the backbone of all, well, almost all website. It is used to construct almost all the websites on the web.
		</p>
		<h3 class="pgl">
			<em>Where did it come from?</em>
		</h3>
		<p class="pgl">
			HTML was made by the man Tim Bernes-Lee.
		</p>
		<h3 class="pg">
			<em>How is it written?</em>
		</h3>
		<p class="pg">
			HTML is written by using tags. Tags catagorize what text should look like. An example would be the h1 tag. Tags are enclosed by <>. An h1 tag is used make text big, like a title. An h1 tag was used to make the What Is HTML.
		</p>
		<h1 class="pgl">
			<em>What Is CSS?</em>
		</h1>
		<p class="pgl">
			CSS is what is used to give the text more flare. If you think of HTML as the skeleton, CSS would be the muscle, skin and makeup on the rest of the body so it will look nice. CSS is used by selecting an identifier. An identifier can be a class, a set word or letters that the user wants to be. An identifier can also be a tag from HTML. After the identifier has been selected, the user can design the text. An example of what it would look like is as follows:
		</p>
		<p class="pgl">
			.ttlrgt{
			text-align: right;
			font-size: 20px;
			}
			The . symbol means that it is a class identifier so that means all text that belongs to this class, with have these atributes. The text-allign: right; means that the text will be alligned to the right of whatever the text is in. The font-size is pretty self explanitory. The size is mesured in pixels.
		</p>
		<h1 class="pg">
			<em>How do tags work?</em>
		</h1>
		<p class="pg">
			Tags are what are used to orginize all the text that the user has put in. There a large amount of tags, to only name a few: p, span, em, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, table, tr, td and many more.
		</p>
		<h1 class="pg">
			<em>What are attributes?</em>
		</h1>
		<p class="pg">
			Attributes are like tags for CSS. They make text go places, do cetrain things and look a specific way. An example of an attribute would be: color: blue. This would set the text in or of the specified thing to blue.
		</p>
		<h1 class="pg">
			<em>Examples of tags and what they do</em>
		</h1>
		<p class="pg">
			The "span" tag. The span tag is used to select a specific point of text to be modified.
		</p>
		<p class="pg">
			The "p" tag. The p tag is used for basic paragraphs such as this one that you are reading.
		</p>
		<p class="pg">
			The h1 tag. The h1 tag is used to make title to things. Multiple examples can be seen on this page such as the main title, What is html?
		</p>
		<p class="pg">
			The em tag. The em in the em tag is short for emphasis. You put it around a peice of text to make it italicized.
